Project is working as expected with no build or runtime errors on Xcode 10.3.
The app has been designed for the iPhone SE (1st generation), however it will also work on other models.
The UI tests were designed for the iPhone SE (1st generation), as per the assignment specification. Please make sure you have this device selected, when running UI tests.

_API Limitations_
The API we are using can only be accessed 5 times per minute, therefore you may experience issues when testing.
If you are accessing the API more than 5 times per minute, you will have to wait momentarily before being able to proceed. This is a limitation of the free API.
